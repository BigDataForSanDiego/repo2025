There are a growing number of homeless encampments surrounding our community and encroaching upon it, both on city owned property, CalTrans property, and our own private property via breached fences securing the freeway and riverbed area.  In light of the terrible wildfires in Los Angeles, and considering our own history of fires started by these encampments, which including recently are still commonplace, I am tremendously concerned about the safety of my person and my property.  I understand many reports and calls have been made to the relevant outlets and authorities without resolve. We need action before a tragedy occurs. This is a 100% preventable risk, similar to the loss of homes in the recent floods nearby due to the city?s inaction at clearing encampments which ultimately blocked flood channels.",10

They separated and one of them had what looked like a gas can in his hand and slowly walked by this one car. A police unit happened by and stopped at the red light and the guy kept back in the shadows for a minute , and then he crossed the street and went straight to the encampment I'm reporting. I looked down and saw about 6 or 7 people dressed mostly in black standing there talking. Some had full-looking backpacks and some had long (mid-thigh) black coats. This is unusual around here.

Today, we had a homeless person walk through the canyon and trespass into the fenced-off back yard of our house on Lincoln Ave. We do not feel safe in our home, and we are fearful of the encampment starting a fire in the canyon that is full of dead trees and brush. For our safety, and the safety of all those who live on this canyon (Lincoln, Hayes, Vermont, Pascoe streets), PLEASE clear this encampment. Thank you.",10

I've been unable to confirm the latter but did see 10+ cop cars in the public parking lot the morning of the incident and the exit ramp to the 5 was closed. While I am sympathetic to whomever is in between housing, this has gone too far. There always a lot of trash, shattered glass, yelling, I saw two people throwing rocks at each other while another's bike was being stolen (a man walking his dog had to put the fight to a stop/the bike was still stolen), etc., going on there and it's become non-safe for local residents. Can you please address this ASAP?! We've seen numerous encampments here, and they are typically cleared within a month but this one has been here for several months and is only growing.

During the evening and overnight hours, we?ve seen individuals in the area jumping our fences and digging through trash bins on both sides of E Street.Unfortunately, this has led to property damage?including scattered debris and some damage to parked company vehicles. We?ve also observed individuals coming from encampments located along the 94 Freeway into this area.To help deter this activity, we?re requesting additional patrol coverage in the E Street and Sunrise Street cul-de-sac. A visible security presence would likely serve as a strong deterrent and help neutralize the ongoing issues. I can provide more information if needed.

Mountain View, a little south of Adams Ave. We have a fire hydrant on the corner with an extension that is being used by large trucks to refill their water tanks. These trucks, some as big as my house, pull up to the hydrant at all hours of the day and night. I have heard their massive engines idling outside my home, and literally shaking the walls at midnight, 3 AM and 4 AM. They also undertake this 20-minute procedure during the day. At least 10 people live in the apartment building next to the fire hydrant who also experience these disturbances, as well as my neighbors in other nearby residences. There are fire hydrants nearby that are not close to homes and apartments. The one on Cherokee outside the now-closed RiteAid is available as well as the one on the next block, 36th Street, next to Vons. These would easier for major trucks to access and give us some peace.
