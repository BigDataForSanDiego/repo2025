#### Your team's hackathon idea in one sentence:
##### An application that functions like a TurboTax for public benefits, using unhoused individuals’ profile data to guide them toward applications for programs like CalFresh, CalWORKs, Medi-Cal, and federal benefits, explaining eligibility requirements and steps to qualify, while also providing assistance (e.g., autofilling PDFs) to complete application forms.
