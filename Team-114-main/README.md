## What Is Resourcify?

Resourcify is a simple, supportive web app designed to help individuals and families keep track of their essential supplies.  
By taking a photo of the items they have, users receive clear guidance on what those items are, how they fit into daily needs, and what they might consider adding to stay prepared and secure.

The goal is to offer clarity and confidence to people who may be facing housing instability, major financial strain, or unexpected life changes.
