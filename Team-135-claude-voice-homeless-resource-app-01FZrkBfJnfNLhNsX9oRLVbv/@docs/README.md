# Homebase Documentation Index

Welcome to the canonical documentation set for Team 135's Homebase initiative. This folder centralizes every guide engineers, designers, and deployment teams need to ship, scale, and operate the platform confidently.

## How to Use This Folder
- **Start with the [Product Overview](product-overview.md)** to understand the mission, personas, and experience map that inform every build decision.
- **Reference the [System Architecture](system-architecture.md)** whenever you need to explain data flows, hosting, or compliance posture.
- **Dive into [Frontend](frontend.md)** and [Backend](backend.md) guides for implementation details, directory conventions, and integration surfaces.
- **Follow the [Operations Playbook](operations.md)** for environment setup, deployment steps, and QA gates.
- **Consult the [Page Experience Handbook](page-handbook.md)** when planning UX revisions or content audits.
- **Contributor workflows remain in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)** and are mirrored where relevant throughout these documents.
